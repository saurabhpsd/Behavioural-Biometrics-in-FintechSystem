## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an AI-powered Behavioral Analytics Framework for fraud detection in FinTech systems using multimodal behavioral biometrics.

The system continuously monitors user interaction patterns such as:

- ⌨️ Keystroke Dynamics  
- 🖱 Mouse Movement Patterns  
- 📱 Touch Gesture Behavior  

By integrating CNN, Random Forest, Mahalanobis Distance, Cohort Analysis, and SHAP-based Explainable AI, the framework provides real-time continuous authentication while reducing false positives.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional fraud detection systems:
- Depend on static rules & MFA
- Are vulnerable to phishing & SIM-swapping
- Produce high false positives
- Cannot detect behavioral impersonation

This project solves these limitations using AI-driven behavioral biometrics.
